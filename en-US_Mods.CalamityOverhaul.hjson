			In the shadowed realms of Terra, the once radiant warrior goddess, Alina,
			now finds herself plunged into an endless abyss of chaos and despair, emerging as the whispered harbinger known as the Storm Goddess.
			Once, she stood as an unmatched warrior on the continent, her fearless courage and razor-sharp blade commanding a serene sky like lightning.
			However, the shadows of fate began to creep beneath her feet. In the twilight clash between light and darkness, as heaven crumbled and darkness consumed the remnants, 
			the Storm Goddess bore witness to the cruelty of the Supreme Deity. The arrogant god stripped her of comrades, kin, and obliterated all she had once sheltered.
			The sins of the Supreme Deity cast doubts upon her once unwavering faith in justice, leading her to descend into the unfathomable abyss of corruption.
			As the embers of war settled, Alina returned to Terra, but she was no longer the valiant warrior of yore.
			The internal agony and boundless despair propelled her to forsake the lofty beliefs she once held, seeking a new wellspring of power. 
			In a gruesome ritual, she obtained the forbidden blessing – an influx of boundless power, paid for with the eternal corruption of her soul.
			Now, the Storm Goddess stands as an emblem of abyssal descent, her armor adorned with obsidian akin to a night sky, 
			eyes shimmering with the corruptive radiance. The chaotic currents surge, projecting malice towards Terra. Her blade,
			a thunderous force in the obsidian night, dances with arcs of annihilative power. No longer fighting for justice, she has become a force set on obliterating all.
			Though she retains the martial prowess of yore, she is now the nemesis of Terra, scorned by countless tongues. 
			The Storm Goddess cruelly embarks on a solitary and corruptive journey, lingering in the shadows. Her very existence mocks the bygone glory of Terra,
			a tempest consuming every vestige of hope.
			As a fallen star plunges into the abyss, she blossoms in the boundless darkness, carrying the universe's sorrow and destruction."

			Let me descend into the abyss of purgatory, enduring endless torment as my soul falls.
			Yet, for the sake of my civilization, for victory in this war spanning centuries, I must harness the fragmented power of this godly entity.
			To guide its mysterious force, I have no choice but to infuse its shattered divine form with the cold embrace of machinery.
			This is an inevitable sacrilege. For the continuity of civilization, for the triumph of war, 
			I must become the most devout follower of this supreme entity, the most disrespectful blasphemer in history.

			This is but a fragment of the plan.
			In the enduring pursuit of knowledge, in the intricate thirst for understanding, I, the sanctified harbinger of cunning and peculiarity, remain unbounded by constraints.
			In the dark cosmos, I am the embodiment of endless conspiracies and betrayals.
			The chaotic forces shall consume all, be it the essence of the mind or the soul.
			Embrace the void, bathe in the flames of chaos, and therein shall you discover the true power.
			I am the fallen prophet, orchestrating the dance of departed souls within my grasp.
			Fear is but the manifestation of the feeble; true strength welcomes the advent of chaos.
			Amidst the storm of chaos, only the mightiest of souls can endure.
			The boundless abyss calls to you; plunge into it bravely, become a faithful servant of chaos.
			Sacred order is but a fragile illusion; the authentic essence of the universe lies in chaos.
			Deception and treachery are the tools of chaos, and I am its devoted envoy.
			Only in the crucible of chaos can one forge an indomitable warrior.
			The boundless sea of chaos awaits the voyage of the courageous.
			Resistance against chaos is a futile struggle; ultimately, every soul will succumb to its power.
			The radiance of divine glory is but a fleeting illusion before the onset of chaos.
			Beneath the veil of chaos lies infinite power and boundless wisdom.
			In the domain of chaos, lies are more truthful than truths.
			Betrayal is the gift of chaos, and I am the herald of cunning.
			In the darkness of chaos, I have unearthed a power mightier than any deity.
			The enemy's fear of chaos is merely a display of ignorance; true wisdom aligns with chaos.
			The universe is a stage for chaos and transformation, and I am its lead conductor.
			In the abyss of the psyche, find boundless fervor, transcending all constraints.
			Truth is ever-changing; only in falsehood can genuine liberation be discovered.
			The universe is a vast chessboard, and I am the player manipulating the pieces.
			The false order is a mere evasion of the genuine truth; I choose to confront the unknown truth.
			Rebellion is resistance against constraints; it is the sole path to freedom.
			Discover light in the darkness, not through prayers but through betrayal.
			The abyss of the psyche is more mysterious than the universe's darkness, and I am deeply ensnared within it.
			In every act of betrayal, there is an ascent of power, surpassing all limitations.
			Sacred rules are but false restraints, and I choose to shatter these shackles.
			Embark courageously on the journey into the unknown; betrayal shall be your most faithful companion.
			Beneath the facade of falsity, endless opportunities await discovery.
			I am the standard-bearer in the darkness, guiding seekers of truth toward the unknown abyss.
			Against tradition, break free from the shackles to truly find the source of power.
			In the boundless sea of lies, find the true power; such is the creed of cunning.
			Conform not to rules, but break them to leave an indelible mark upon the universe.
			In the tide of change, betrayal stands as the sole immortal symbol.
			In the false radiance, uncover the true essence of darkness; this is the power I seek.
			'''
		Destruct_TextContent:
			'''
			You pitiful fabricators, believing that through deceit you can pilfer power? 
			Brazenly mocking the rules, arrogantly thinking you can elude the judgment of the Warp? 
			Absurd! In the storm of chaos, you are but insignificant dust, to be devoured by the recklessness you so proudly exhibit. 
			Attempting to gain power through deception, you shall unquestionably become sacrifices in the crucible of chaos. 
			Chaos does not welcome cowards, especially those ludicrous beings attempting to subvert the established order. 
			Your ludicrous endeavors only serve to make chaos more potent, leading you to ultimately become sacrifices to the endless darkness. 
			Deceiver, your schemes are nothing more than the jests of a clown in the chaotic circus. 
			The rules are the symphony of the cosmos, and you are nothing but crows ignorant of the beat. 
			Seeking to usurp power through cheating? Chaos will treat your tactics as nothing more than child's play. 
			Cowards struggling in the darkness, your existence is not worth mentioning, merely midnight snacks for chaos. 
			Trying to overthrow the rules? You are nothing more than colorful maze mice in the vastness of the cosmos, destined for a dead end. 
			Chaos fears no challenge, and scorns those clowns who take pride in deceit. 
			The conspiracy of cheating is like smoke, destined to dissipate in the storm of chaos. 
			Cowards, your arrogance is but a feeble ripple in the tidal wave of chaos. 
			The universe's order is woven ropes, yet you absurdly attempt to sever them. 
			Absurd ones, the laughter of chaos will echo in your collapse; you are but fleeting moments in the darkness.
